## 🔒 Mandatory Tooling Requirement

All participants must maintain **ChatGPT Plus ($19.99/month)**.

This is not optional.

Flame Division trains **AI operators**, not observers.  
All simulations, assessments, and system builds assume access to advanced AI reasoning models.

- No affiliation with OpenAI
- No commissions or referrals
- Required purely for operational parity

If you cannot invest in your tools, this is not your dojo.
