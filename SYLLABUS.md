✅ Core Course Requirement (Mandatory)

All students enrolled in Flame Division Academy are required to have:

ChatGPT Plus — $19.99/month

This is not an upsell and not optional.

Why this is required

This academy does not teach theory-only AI.
You are trained as a system operator, not a spectator.

ChatGPT Plus provides:
	•	✅ Stable access to advanced reasoning models
	•	✅ Consistent performance under pressure tasks
	•	✅ Multi-step system building support
	•	✅ Real-time iteration, critique, and correction
	•	✅ The same tool used throughout all Flame Division demos and curricula

Without it, you cannot complete the training as designed.

Important clarification
	•	Flame Division Academy is not affiliated with OpenAI
	•	We receive no commission, referral, or compensation
	•	This requirement exists solely because it is the most reliable baseline tool for the skills taught

Think of it like required equipment:

You don’t train pilots without a cockpit.
You don’t train operators without a capable AI interface.

Student Responsibility Acknowledgment

By enrolling, you acknowledge:
	•	You are responsible for maintaining your own ChatGPT Plus subscription
	•	Tool access is part of professional readiness
	•	Skill development requires investment, not shortcuts

  If you can’t invest $19.99 in your tooling, you are not ready to lead AI systems.
